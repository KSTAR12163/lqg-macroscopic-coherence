# Week 1 Progress Log

**Week**: October 13-20, 2025  
**Phase**: D - Tier 1 Collective Enhancement  
**Objective**: Establish empirical scaling law g_eff(N) ∝ N^α

---

## Day 1: Analytical Bounds ✅ (Oct 13, 2025)

### Execution
**Script**: `run_week1_day1.py`  
**Command**: `python run_week1_day1.py`  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Results

#### For Full Warp Viability (g₀ = 10⁻⁵⁰ J):
| Scaling Type | Formula | Required N | Assessment |
|-------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Incoherent (√N) | g ∝ √N | 6.38×10¹⁴⁰ | **PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE** |
| Coherent (N) | g ∝ N | 2.53×10⁷⁰ | **UNPHYSICAL** (> atoms in universe) |
| Superradiant (N²) | g ∝ N² | 1.59×10³⁵ | **HIGHLY SPECULATIVE** |

#### For Tier 1 Target (10⁶× enhancement):
| Scaling Type | Required N | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| √N | 10¹² | ✅ **FEASIBLE** |
| N | 10⁶ | ✅ **FEASIBLE** |
| N² | 10³ | ✅ **FEASIBLE** |

### Key Insights

1. **Gap Analysis**: Even 10⁶× enhancement is **64 orders of magnitude short** of warp viability
2. **Tier 1 Limitation**: Collective enhancement alone **CANNOT** close the full gap
3. **Value of Measurement**: Establishes quantitative benchmark for LQG collective effects

### Decision
✅ **PROCEED** to numerical measurements (Days 2-5)

**Rationale**: 
- Empirical α measurement provides valuable benchmarking
- Validates/refutes theoretical scaling predictions
- Quantitative null result has scientific value
- Informs Week 4 gate decision (GO to Tier 2 vs. SKIP to Tier 3)

## Day 2: Network Construction ⏳ (Oct 14, 2025)

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement `create_complete_network(N)` function
  - All-to-all connectivity (N(N-1)/2 edges)
  - Klein-Gordon propagator for each edge
  - Effective coupling matrix construction
  
- [ ] Implement `create_lattice_network(N)` function
  - Cubic lattice (N = L³ nodes)
  - Nearest-neighbor connections only
  - Distance-dependent coupling decay

- [ ] Test with small N
  - N = 10 (complete graph: 45 edges)
  - N = 50 (complete graph: 1225 edges)
  - Verify coupling calculation with guardrails

### Expected Challenges
- **Matrix size**: N² scaling for complete graph Hamiltonian
- **Numerical precision**: Coupling still below 10⁻⁵⁰ J threshold
- **Implementation**: Need actual Matter-Geometry coupling formula

### Mitigation Strategy
- Use sparse matrices for large N
- Accept guardrail warnings (measuring scaling, not reaching viability)
- Review existing Phase 1 code for coupling implementation

---

## Day 3: Network Construction (continued) ⏳

### Tasks
- [ ] Debug network construction
- [ ] Verify Hamiltonian structure (non-diagonal)
- [ ] Test coupling measurement for N = 10, 50
- [ ] Document implementation details

---

## Days 4-5: Scaling Measurements ⏳

### Measurement Plan
**N-values**: [10, 50, 100, 500, 1000]  
**Topologies**: Complete graph (primary), Lattice (comparison)

For each N:
1. Build network with chosen topology
2. Measure g_eff(N) using Matter-Geometry coupling
3. Validate with guardrails (expect warnings for weak coupling)
4. Record: (N, g_eff, topology)

### Analysis
- Plot: log(g_eff) vs. log(N)
- Fit: g_eff = A × N^α
- Extract: Scaling exponent α ± uncertainty
- Compare: α vs. predictions (0.5, 1.0, 2.0)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] At least 5 data points collected
- [ ] Clear trend visible in log-log plot
- [ ] α determined with ≤ 20% uncertainty
- [ ] Comparison to theoretical predictions documented

---

## Days 6-7: Week 1 Report ⏳

### Deliverable: `WEEK1_REPORT.md`

**Required Sections**:
1. **Analytical Predictions** (from Day 1)
   - Table of N requirements for each scaling
   - Feasibility assessment

2. **Empirical Measurements** (from Days 4-5)
   - Data table: N, g_eff, topology
   - Log-log plot with fit
   - Measured α value

3. **Comparison**
   - Prediction vs. measurement
   - Interpretation of α value

4. **Extrapolation**
   - Required N for Tier 1 target (10⁶×) with measured α
   - Required N for warp viability (10⁷¹×) with measured α
   - Feasibility assessment

5. **Decision**
   - [ ] Continue to full Tier 1 (Weeks 2-4)?
   - [ ] Skip to Tier 3 immediately?
   - Justification based on measured α

### Decision Criteria
- **α ≥ 1.3** (super-linear): ✅ GO to Weeks 2-4 (interesting physics!)
- **0.7 ≤ α ≤ 1.3** (linear): ⚠️ MAYBE (document and evaluate)
- **α < 0.7** (sub-linear): ❌ SKIP to Tier 3 (collective insufficient)

## Notes & Observations

### Oct 13, 2025 (Day 1)
✅ Analytical bounds completed successfully. Key finding: Even Tier 1 target (10⁶×) is 64 orders short of warp viability. This confirms Phase D strategy - need exotic mechanisms (Tier 3) for success. However, measurements still valuable for benchmarking.

**Quote from output**:
> "Even if α ~ 0.5 (incoherent), the measurement provides:
> ✓ Benchmark for collective enhancement in LQG
> ✓ Validation of theoretical predictions
> ✓ Quantitative null result for documentation"

**Verdict**: Continue with measurements. Empirical α establishes quantitative baseline regardless of outcome.
