- Scaling law validated: how $f_{\text{eff}}$ varies with coarse-graining scale L

**Failure criteria**:
- $f_{\text{eff}} > 10^{-6}$ for all parameters → Insufficient even with coherence
- No clear scaling law → Theory lacks predictive power

**Deliverables**:

**Either way**: 
- Answer fundamental question about nature of spacetime
- Advance human knowledge significantly
- Develop new quantum gravity engineering tools
