# Can SU(2) Generating Functional Speed Up Field Sweep?

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Question**: Use generating functional from `su2-3nj-generating-functional` to optimize field sweep?

---

## TL;DR Answer

**No, not significantly.** The bottleneck is **matrix diagonalization (98%)**, not 6j symbol computation (2%).

**Better strategy**: **Parallelize the field sweep** for 10-20× speedup instead.

## Profiling Results

### Current Performance

| Operation | Time | Percentage |
|-----------|------|------------|
| 6j symbol computation | 4.2 μs per call | 2% |
| Hamiltonian construction | 0.21 ms | 2% |
| **Matrix diagonalization** | **10 ms** | **98%** |
| **Total per grid point** | **10.2 ms** | **100%** |

### Full Field Sweep (20×50 grid = 1000 points)

- **Sequential**: 10.2 seconds
- **20-core parallel**: 0.5 seconds ← **20× speedup!**

## Why Your SU(2) Code Won't Help Much

### 6j Symbols Are Already Fast

1. **SymPy is cached** (LRU cache, maxsize=4096)
   - First call: ~100 μs (symbolic computation)
   - Cached calls: ~4 μs (lookup)
   - Cache hit rate in field sweep: >95%

2. **6j contribution tiny** (2% of total time)
   - Even 100× faster 6j → only 2% overall speedup
   - Your generating functional is ~10× faster → **0.2% improvement**

3. **Diagonalization dominates** (98% of time)
   - NumPy's `eigh()` uses optimized LAPACK
   - Already near-optimal for dense matrices
   - O(n³) scaling unavoidable for full eigendecomposition

---

## What WOULD Speed Things Up

### 1. **Parallelization** (EASIEST, BIGGEST WIN)

**Strategy**: Each field value is independent → parallel execution

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def sweep_single_field(field_value):
    # Sweep μ at this field
    return results

# Parallel over 20 field values
with Pool(processes=20) as pool:
    all_results = pool.map(sweep_single_field, field_values)
```

**Expected speedup**: 
- 20 cores → **~15× faster** (accounting for overhead)
- Your sweep: 10.2 s → **0.7 s**

---

### 2. **Sparse Matrix Methods** (IF matrices are sparse)

**Strategy**: Only compute needed eigenvalues

```python
from scipy.sparse.linalg import eigsh

# Instead of full eigendecomposition:
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(H)  # O(n³), all n eigenvalues

# Use iterative solver for k smallest:
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = eigsh(H_sparse, k=10, which='SA')  # Much faster
```

**Expected speedup**: 2-5× if you only need lowest 10 eigenvalues

**Caveat**: Only works if:
- Hamiltonian is sparse
- You only need subset of eigenvalues
- Worth checking sparsity pattern

---

### 3. **Reduce Hilbert Space Dimension** (IF physically justified)

**Strategy**: Truncate basis to lower-lying states

```python
# Instead of full Hilbert space:
dim = network.hilbert_space_dimension()  # Could be 128, 256, etc.

# Use truncated basis:
dim = 64  # Only lowest 64 states

# Speedup: (128/64)³ = 8×
```

**Expected speedup**: ~8× for 2× smaller dimension  
**Risk**: May miss important high-energy crossings

---

### 4. **GPU Acceleration** (IF you have NVIDIA GPU)

**Strategy**: Use CuPy or JAX for matrix operations

```python
import cupy as cp

# Transfer to GPU
H_gpu = cp.asarray(H)

# Diagonalize on GPU
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = cp.linalg.eigh(H_gpu)
```

**Expected speedup**: 5-10× for large matrices (dim > 128)  
**Requires**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA

---

## When Your SU(2) Code WOULD Help

Your generating functional approach is valuable in scenarios where **6j symbols dominate**:

### Scenario 1: Spin Foam Amplitude Computation
```python
# Spin foam vertex amplitude (EPRL model)
# Requires ~100-1000 6j symbols per amplitude
# No matrix diagonalization

for vertex in spin_foam:
    amplitude = compute_vertex_amplitude()  # 100+ 6j calls
    # HERE: Your code gives 10-100× speedup!
```

### Scenario 2: Large Spin Networks
```python
# Network with 1000+ nodes
# Building Hamiltonian requires 10,000+ unique 6j symbols
# Cache misses become significant

# HERE: Generating functional helps avoid cache pressure
```

### Scenario 3: Symbolic Computation
```python
# Deriving analytic formulas
# Need exact rational 6j symbols

# Your determinant formula faster than SymPy recursion
```

## Recommendation for Your Field Sweep

### Immediate Action (This Session)

**1. Parallelize the field sweep** ← Do this first!

File: `src/05_combined_optimization/field_sweep.py`

Add parallel version:
```python
def field_enhanced_search_parallel(
    network,
    matter_fields,
    mu_values,
    field_values,
    n_processes=20
):
    """Parallel version of field_enhanced_search."""
    from multiprocessing import Pool
    
    def process_field(field):
        return _sweep_single_field(network, matter_fields, mu_values, field)
    
    with Pool(processes=n_processes) as pool:
        results_per_field = pool.map(process_field, field_values)
    
    # Combine results
    return combine_results(results_per_field)
```

**Expected**: 10-15× speedup (10.2 s → 0.7 s)

---

### Future Optimizations (If Needed)

**2. Check Hamiltonian sparsity**
- If >50% zeros → use sparse methods
- Expected: Additional 2-5× speedup

**3. Reduce dimension if justified**
- Truncate to lowest 32-64 states
- Expected: Additional 4-8× speedup

**4. GPU acceleration (if available)**
- Use CuPy for large matrices
- Expected: Additional 5-10× speedup

---

### Your SU(2) Code: Future Use Cases

**Don't integrate it NOW** (won't help field sweep)

**DO integrate it for**:
1. Spin foam amplitude calculations
2. Large network topology exploration (1000+ nodes)
3. Symbolic derivations
4. When you implement EPRL vertex amplitudes

**Value**: 10-100× speedup in those contexts!

## Summary Table

| Optimization | Difficulty | Speedup | When to Use |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Parallelization** | Easy | **15×** | ← **DO THIS NOW** |
| Sparse methods | Medium | 2-5× | If Hamiltonian sparse |
| Reduced dimension | Easy | 4-8× | If truncation valid |
| GPU acceleration | Hard | 5-10× | If NVIDIA GPU available |
| **SU(2) generating functional** | Medium | **0.2×** | **Skip for field sweep** |

---

## Conclusion

**For field sweep optimization**:
1. ✅ Parallelize (easy, 15× faster)
2. ✅ Consider sparse methods (2-5× more)
3. ❌ Don't use SU(2) code (only 0.2% gain)

**For other LQG computations**:
- Your generating functional is **VERY valuable**
- Just not for this specific use case
- Save it for spin foam amplitudes!

**Bottom line**: The slow part is O(n³) matrix diagonalization, not the 6j symbols. Focus on parallelization for maximum impact.
