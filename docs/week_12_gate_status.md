# Week 12 Gate Status Report

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Assessment**: **INCONCLUSIVE** (placeholder physics prevents definitive ruling)  
**Recommendation**: Complete infrastructure, then re-evaluate

---

## Executive Summary

**Portal coupling enhancement** (Phase D, Tier 3): ✅ **VALIDATED**
- Conservative g_eff = 1.47×10⁻²¹ J (29 orders above threshold)
- Proper dimensional analysis, experimental constraints satisfied
- 95% CI robustly above Week 4 gate (1e-50 J)

**Warp bubble viability** (Phase D, Warp Evaluation): ⚠️ **INCONCLUSIVE**
- Current stress-energy uses placeholders (not computed from real metrics)
- Portal "boost" is heuristic division (not field-theory-derived δT_μν)
- ANEC checks use toy T_μν (not integrated along null geodesics)
- **Cannot make rigorous Week 12 decision with placeholder physics**

## What We Know (High Confidence)

### Portal Coupling: ✅ Validated Physics

**Conservative Model**:
```
g_eff = (g_aγγ × g_aN × n_N) × (u_field × V) × λ_a² × ħ
     = 1.47×10⁻²¹ J
```

- ✅ Field parameter specification (B, E, V)

**Uncertainty Quantification**:
- 95% CI: [1.58×10⁻³⁵, 5.88×10⁻²⁶] J (smoke test, 20 samples)
- All samples pass experimental constraints (0% exclusion)
- Dynamic range: ~12 orders (field parameter variation dominates)

## What We Don't Know (Placeholder Physics)

### Warp Evaluation: ⚠️ Requires Real Computation

**Current Placeholder Issues**:

1. **Stress-Energy from Metrics** (`stress_energy.py`):
   - STATUS: Scaffolded infrastructure, marked TODO
   - WHAT'S MISSING:
     - Proper Christoffel symbol calculation from metric
     - Numerical derivatives (finite differences or symbolic)
     - Einstein tensor computation: G_μν = R_μν - (1/2)R g_μν
     - T_μν = (c⁴/8πG) G_μν
   - CURRENT: Uses toy Gaussian wall profile (not derived from metric)

2. **Portal δT_μν** (`portal_stress_energy.py`):

## Week 12 Gate Criteria (Reminder)

**From FTL_ACTION_PLAN.md**:

**PASS** requires:
- ✅ At least 1 warp bubble candidate theoretically viable
- ✅ ANEC satisfied (or QI-bounded violations)
- ✅ Stability spectrum shows no exponential growth
- ✅ Energy requirements < 10⁵⁰ J (solar mass-energy order)
- ✅ Field requirements within 10³× of current technology

**FAIL** triggers:
- ❌ All candidates violate ANEC by >10 orders
- ❌ Required exotic energy > 10⁵⁵ J (galactic scale)
- ❌ Fundamental instabilities (sub-microsecond collapse)

---

## Current Preliminary Results (Placeholder-Based)

**From Last Run** (`warp_eval/runner.py` with placeholders):

| Candidate | Speed | Score | ANEC | Stability | Realizability | Viable? |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Alcubierre Classic | 10c | 20/100 | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Smooth Dome | 1c | 60/100 | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Alpha Centauri | 4c | 20/100 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Conservative | 1.1c | 40/100 | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Aggressive | 100c | 20/100 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Result**: 0/5 viable

**Portal Boost Applied**: 10¹⁰⁰× (heuristic division by baseline g_eff = 1e-121 J)

**⚠️ WARNING**: This conclusion is premature because:
- T_μν not computed from actual metrics
- δT_portal not derived from field theory
- ANEC not integrated along real geodesics
- All checks use placeholders

---

## Honest Assessment

### What's Likely True (Physical Intuition)

**Geometry is the bottleneck, not coupling**:
- Alcubierre metric requires T_00 ~ -10⁴⁰ J/m³ in bubble wall
- Portal provides g_eff ~ 10⁻²¹ J spread over ~1 m³ → δρ ~ 10⁻²¹ J/m³
- Ratio: δρ_portal / ρ_metric ~ 10⁻²¹ / 10⁴⁰ = 10⁻⁶¹ (negligible)
- **Portal cannot fix geometric energy condition violations**

**ANEC is likely violated**:
- No known mechanism for sustained macroscopic negative energy
- Casimir effect: localized, tiny (femtojoules at nanometer scales)
- Quantum field theory: energy conditions from causality + spectral positivity
- **Warp bubble wall systematically violates ANEC along null rays**

**Stability is questionable**:
- Negative energy regions generically unstable (like negative mass)
- Perturbations grow exponentially (timescale ~ R/c ~ microseconds for 100 m bubble)
- **Even if constructed, bubble likely collapses immediately**

### What We Don't Know (Requires Calculation)

**Magnitude of ANEC violation**:
- Is it 10 orders? 40 orders? 100 orders?
- Quantifies "how impossible" warp drives are
- Identifies specific bottleneck for future work

**Portal contribution to δT_μν**:
- Heuristic "boost" is unphysical
- Real EFT calculation could be orders of magnitude different
- Medium effects (screening, saturation) unknown without derivation

**Stability timescale**:
- Random eigenvalues don't tell us collapse rate
- Real spectrum needed for "how long would bubble last?"
- Relevant for experimental tests (microseconds? nanoseconds?)

**Realizability engineering**:
- What HTS coil configuration would be needed (if possible)?
- Power consumption, material stress, cooling requirements
- Could inform scaled-down lab tests

---

## Decision: INCONCLUSIVE

### Rationale

**Cannot gate Week 12 with placeholder physics** because:

1. **T_μν from metrics**: Core calculation missing (not just "to be refined")
2. **δT_portal from EFT**: Heuristic boost unphysical (not just "conservative estimate")
3. **ANEC integration**: Stub implementation untested (not just "needs validation")
4. **All energy condition checks**: Use toy inputs (not derived from candidate metrics)

**Directional intuition suggests FAIL**, but:
- Magnitude of failure unknown (10⁰ vs 10¹⁰⁰ difference matters)
- Specific bottleneck unidentified (ANEC? Stability? Realizability?)
- No quantitative path to improvement

**Engineering principle**: "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"
- Claim: Portal coupling enables warp drives
- Evidence: Placeholder calculations
- **Verdict**: Insufficient evidence to decide

---

## Path Forward

### Immediate (Weeks 13-14): Metric Stress-Energy

**Goal**: Compute T_μν from real warp bubble metrics

**Tasks**:
1. Implement `compute_einstein_tensor()` in `stress_energy.py`:
   - Christoffel symbols via finite differences
   - Riemann → Ricci → Einstein tensor
   - Validate on Schwarzschild (known T_μν = 0)

2. Load metrics from existing repos:
   - `warp-bubble-metric-ansatz`: Alcubierre, Natário, Van Den Broeck
   - `warp-bubble-einstein-equations`: Validation data

3. Compute T_μν at grid of points around bubble

**Deliverable**: Real stress-energy profiles for 3+ candidate metrics

### Near-Term (Weeks 15-16): Portal δT_μν from EFT

**Goal**: Derive portal contribution from field theory

**Tasks**:
1. Start from Lagrangian:
   ```
   L_eff = L_SM + (g_aγ/4) a F·F̃ + (g_aN/f_a) a N̄ N
   ```

2. Derive modified energy-momentum tensor:
   ```
   T^μν = T^μν_EM + T^μν_axion + T^μν_int
   ```

3. Include medium effects:
   - Plasma screening: ω_p, λ_D
   - Coherence suppression: finite size/time
   - Saturation: perturbativity limits

4. Implement in `portal_stress_energy_eft.py`

**Deliverable**: Field-theory-derived δT_μν with proper medium effects

### Mid-Term (Weeks 17-18): ANEC Integration

**Goal**: Integrate ∫ T_μν k^μ k^ν dλ along real null geodesics

**Tasks**:
1. Complete `geodesics.py`:
   - RK4 integration of geodesic equation
   - Christoffel symbols from metric
   - Adaptive step size near wall

2. Sample multiple geodesics:
   - Radial infall (various impact parameters)
   - Tangential orbits
   - Infalling vs outgoing

3. Compute ANEC statistics across ensemble

**Deliverable**: ANEC violation quantified for real candidate metrics

### Integration (Weeks 19-20): End-to-End Pipeline

**Goal**: Full evaluation with no placeholders

**Tasks**:
1. Update `runner.py`:
   - Replace `compute_portal_boost()` with real `compute_portal_delta_T()`
   - Use `stress_energy_from_metric()` for T_metric
   - Combine: T_total = T_metric + δT_portal

2. Update `energy_conditions.py`:
   - Extract (ρ, p) from computed T_total
   - Integrate ANEC along real geodesics

3. Run full evaluation on 5+ diverse candidates

4. Make evidence-based Week 12 decision

**Deliverable**: Definitive PASS/FAIL with quantitative evidence

## Week 12 Gate: DEFERRED to Week 20

**Current Status**: Insufficient evidence to decide  
**Deferral Reason**: Core calculations incomplete (not just refinements needed)  
**New Target**: Week 20 (after infrastructure completion)

**What This Means**:
- Week 4 gate: ✅ PASSED (portal coupling validated)
- Week 12 gate: ⏳ DEFERRED (warp viability inconclusive)
- Week 24 gate: Still on schedule (allows 4 weeks for completion)

**Risk Assessment**:
- **If we decide now with placeholders**: High risk of wrong conclusion
- **If we defer for real calculations**: Confident, defensible conclusion
- **Schedule impact**: 6-8 week delay vs original plan, but final verdict more rigorous

---

## Recommendation

**Defer Week 12 gate to Week 20** pending:

1. ✅ Real stress-energy from metrics (Weeks 13-14)
2. ✅ Field-theory-derived portal δT_μν (Weeks 15-16)
3. ✅ ANEC integration along geodesics (Weeks 17-18)
4. ✅ Full pipeline testing (Weeks 19-20)

**Expected Outcome** (honest prediction):
- Week 12 gate will likely **FAIL** even with real physics
- But we'll know **why** (ANEC violation by X orders, stability timescale Y μs, etc.)
- Can quantify path to improvement (if any exists)
- Conclusion will be rigorous, not placeholder-based

**Alternative** (if schedule pressure):
- Make preliminary FAIL call based on directional intuition
- Document uncertainty due to placeholder physics
- Continue infrastructure work for quantitative final assessment

**Preferred**: Defer for rigorous conclusion (better science, defensible claims)
